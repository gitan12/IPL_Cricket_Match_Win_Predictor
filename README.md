# IPL Win Probability Predictor

Welcome to the IPL Win Probability Predictor! This project helps predict the chances of winning a cricket match in the IPL (Indian Premier League). Whether you're a cricket enthusiast or just curious about the outcome of IPL matches, this predictor can give you some insights.

## What's Inside?

### Jupyter Notebook

The `IPL Win Probability Predictor.ipynb` file is like a digital playbook. It's where we develop the magic behind predicting win probabilities. Here's what it does:

1. **Data Checkup**: We look at the data to understand what we're dealing with.
2. **Cleaning Up**: We tidy things up, making sure everything's in order.
3. **Exploring the Data**: We dig deep to find interesting patterns and trends.
4. **Building Models**: We train computers to predict win probabilities based on past data.
5. **Checking Accuracy**: We test our models to see how good they are.
6. **Fine-Tuning**: We tweak things here and there to make our predictions as accurate as possible.
7. **Getting Ready to Go Online**: We prepare our model for the web.

### Streamlit Web App

The `app.py` file is like a window to our prediction world. It's built with Streamlit, a tool that makes it easy to turn data projects into cool web apps. Here's what it does:

- **Getting Started**: We set things up to make our app work.
- **Loading the Model**: We bring in the brainy part – our prediction model.
- **Showing You Around**: We create web pages where you can input match details and get predictions.
  - **Home Page**: This is where you input match details.
  - **Prediction Page**: Here, you'll see the predicted win probability.
